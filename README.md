This is a Java Brute Force Password Cracked. It is my project for the Programming 3 course.
It implements 3 solutions:
  - sequential solution
  - parallel solution
  - cuda accelerated solution

Currently the program runs only the sequential version but at the release stage you will run the program from command line and will choose the version with the arguments (1 being sequential, 2 parallel and 3 cuda).
